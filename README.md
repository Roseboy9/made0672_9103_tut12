- **## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration**

I find inspiration in Memo Akten's "[Learning to See](https:https://vimeo.com/260612034) experimental work which presents unexpected transformations of everyday items into creative scenes like oceans morphing into abstract textures or flowers dissolving into dreamlike patterns. 

> I appreciate the piece's deep manipulation of pixels, allowing for various visual effects based on pixel data. 

The work also enables real-time interaction, which means user input can affect the visual output based on coded rules.

Borrowing these techniques, I can modify specific parts of the base image of my major assignment while allowing for user interactions for a *dynamic* and *responsive* artwork.

**Examples from Akten's work:**

- **## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration**

Although Akten’s work relied on sophisticated machine learning procedures, I believe that I can achieve a simpler imitation with Javascript p5.js through such coding techniques as keyboard and mouse input techniques for user interactivity.

In Akten’s work, real-time gestures such as folding a napkin translated into a distinct creative scene. In my major assignment, I can enable user input through variables like `mouseX` and `mouseY` to modify the visual output of my work. If combined with the `draw` function which is called 60 times per second, I can generate dynamism in my work.
